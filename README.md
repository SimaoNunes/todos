# todos

This is one of my first projects that I've developed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. \
It was a project from [this](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) online course that I highly recommend you to check out, if you are giving the first steps in Web Development.

## Start

Access todos through [this](http://web.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/~ist186512/projects/todos/) link or download the repo.
If you downloaded the repo, make sure that there is a browser installed on your computer and start the game by running the HTML file with it.

## Rules
Insert and delete your notes.
